# Autonomous AI Research Crew with CrewAI & Gemini

An end-to-end Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build and orchestrate a multi-agent crew using CrewAI. This project showcases an autonomous team of AI agents that collaborate to research, summarize, and report on a given topic, powered by Google Gemini Pro.

üîç This project builds a crew of agents with distinct roles and a shared goal. They use dynamic tools (like web search) to gather, process, and present information, culminating in a polished, structured report.

## Project Overview

The notebook guides you through the process of defining agents, assigning tasks, and kicking off a crew to perform autonomous research. The agents work in a sequential process to produce a final report.

| Stage | Description | Tools Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Setup & Config** | Load environment variables and initialize the Gemini LLM. | `python-dotenv`, `langchain-google-genai` |
| **2. Tool Definition** | Create a web search tool for agents to use for up-to-date info. | `crewai[tools]`, `duckduckgo-search` |
| **3. Agent Creation** | Define a team of three agents: a Researcher, a Summarizer, and a Reporter, each with a unique role, goal, and backstory. | `crewai`, `langchain-google-genai` |
| **4. Task Assignment**| Create a series of tasks for the agents to perform, from initial research to final report generation. | `crewai` |
| **5. Crew Execution** | Assemble the agents and tasks into a sequential crew and run the process. | `crewai` |
| **6. Final Output** | The crew produces a final, well-structured markdown report on the research topic. | Markdown |

## Key Features
‚úÖ **Autonomous Collaboration**: Watch as specialized AI agents work together to achieve a complex goal.
‚úÖ **Role-Based Personas**: Each agent is defined with a specific role, backstory, and set of capabilities.
‚úÖ **Google Gemini Integration**: Leverages the power of Gemini Pro for sophisticated language understanding and generation.
‚úÖ **Dynamic Tool Usage**: The research agent uses the DuckDuckGo search tool to find real-time, relevant information.
‚úÖ **Sequential Task Orchestration**: Tasks are executed in a logical sequence, with the output of one task feeding into the next.
‚úÖ **Structured Markdown Output**: The final deliverable is a clean, formatted markdown report ready for use.

## Setup and Execution

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Install Required Packages**
```bash
pip install -qU python-dotenv crewai crewai[tools] langchain-google-genai
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure Gemini API Key**
Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Google API Key:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```
The notebook will load this key automatically using `python-dotenv`.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the Notebook**
Execute the cells in the `MultiAgent_CrewApp.ipynb` notebook sequentially. The notebook will define the agents and tasks, run the crew, and print the final markdown report.

## Code Highlights

### Defining an Agent
Each agent is a configurable component with a specific persona and toolset.

```python
# Researcher Agent
researcher = Agent(
    role="Senior Researcher",
    goal="Uncover the latest cutting-edge developments in AI agents and multi-agent systems.",
    backstory="""You are a world-renowned technology researcher, known for your ability to
    dig deep and find the most relevant and impactful information on any tech topic.
    You are a master at using search tools to find hidden gems.""",
    llm=llm,
    tools=[search_tool],
    verbose=True,
    allow_delegation=True
)
```

### Defining a Task
Tasks are the building blocks of the crew's workflow. Each task is assigned to an agent.

```python
# Research Task
task_research = Task(
    description="Find information about the latest AI tools released in 2025.",
    expected_output="Raw text content or bullet points of top 5-10 AI tools.",
    agent=researcher
)
```

### Assembling and Running the Crew
The crew is where the agents and tasks come together, along with a defined process (e.g., sequential).

```python
# Create the Crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, summarizer, reporter],
    tasks=[task_research, task_summarize, task_report],
    process=Process.sequential
)

# Kick off the crew's work
final_output = crew.kickoff()
print(final_output)
```

## Expected Outputs
The final output of the notebook is a complete markdown report generated by the AI crew, detailing the findings of their research task.

### Example Final Report:
```markdown
# AI-Powered Business Solutions: A Comprehensive Overview

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing various industries by offering innovative solutions that enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve decision-making. This report provides an overview of several key AI-powered tools and their applications in different business functions.

## AI Tools and Applications

Here's a detailed look at some prominent AI tools and their applications:

*   **AI-Powered Automation Tools:**
    *   Automate repetitive tasks across various business functions.
    *   Examples: Data entry, invoice processing, and report generation.
    *   Benefits: Improves efficiency and reduces human error.

*   **AI-Driven Customer Service Agents:**
    *   Provide instant and personalized customer support.
    *   Examples: Chatbots and virtual assistants.
    *   Functions: Resolving queries, troubleshooting issues, and enhancing customer satisfaction.

... and so on.
```

## Learning Outcomes
By working through this project, you will:
‚úÖ Understand the fundamental concepts of multi-agent systems.
‚úÖ Learn how to use the CrewAI framework to build and manage autonomous crews.
‚úÖ Define agents with distinct roles, goals, backstories, and tools.
‚úÖ Structure and orchestrate complex workflows by linking tasks together.
‚úÖ Integrate powerful LLMs like Google Gemini into an agentic framework.

## Next Steps
*   **Add More Tools**: Equip agents with more specialized tools, such as API connectors for financial data or code interpreters.
*   **Experiment with Different Processes**: Try a `hierarchical` process instead of `sequential` to see how agent delegation changes the workflow.
*   **Create More Complex Crews**: Build larger crews with more specialized agents to tackle more ambitious tasks.
*   **Deploy as a Service**: Wrap the crew in a simple API using Flask or FastAPI to run it as a background service.
