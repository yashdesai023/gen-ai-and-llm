The Mediterranean diet is a heart-healthy eating plan. 
It's plant-based and typically includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts. 
It also features fish and poultry—lean sources of protein—over red meat. Olive oil is the principal source of fat. 
This diet pattern has been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. 
One of the key components is the high consumption of antioxidants from fresh produce, which helps combat oxidative stress in the body.
 Furthermore, the diet's emphasis on healthy fats, like those found in olive oil and avocados, 
 contributes to improved cholesterol levels.
